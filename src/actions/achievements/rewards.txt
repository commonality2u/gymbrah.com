==== EXAMPLE REWARD CALCULATION ====

Let's say you complete a workout with 5 sets while on a 3-day streak:

1. Base workout completion: +100 points/XP
2. Set completion (5 sets × 10): +50 points/XP
3. Streak bonus (3 days × 50): +150 points/XP
Total for workout: 300 points and 300 XP

If this was your 5th workout, you'd also earn:
- Beginner achievement: +500 points/XP
- Beginner-athlete badge
Total including achievement: 800 points and 800 XP

If this XP pushes you past your current level's threshold:
- Level up: +200 bonus points
- Possible level milestone rewards

The system continuously tracks your progress and awards achievements as you hit milestones across workouts completed, streak days maintained, and levels gained. Each achievement comes with both point rewards and exclusive badges to showcase your progress.

==== WHY SEPARATE POINTS AND XP? ====

The separation of points and XP serves distinct purposes in the gamification system:

Points:
- Act as a spendable currency for future features (rewards shop, challenges)
- Provide immediate gratification and clear progress metrics
- Allow for competitive leaderboards and rankings
- Can be adjusted without affecting level progression

XP:
- Drives the core progression system through levels
- Creates a steady, predictable growth curve
- Maintains long-term engagement through level milestones
- Cannot be spent, ensuring consistent progression tracking

By keeping points and XP separate, we can:
- Adjust point rewards for new features or changes
- Preserve the core leveling system for long-term value
- Provide clear, measurable progress for users

This approach allows us to balance immediate rewards with long-term progression, ensuring a rewarding and engaging experience for all users.
