## üìå How the Flow Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ A Gym Registers an Athlete
‚Ä¢ Creates a new athlete with a unique athlete_code.
‚Ä¢ Sends an invite email/SMS with the code.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The Athlete Signs Up
‚Ä¢ If the email matches an existing invite, the user is linked automatically.
‚Ä¢ Otherwise, they can manually enter the athlete_code to get associated.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Workout Assignment & Tracking
‚Ä¢ The workout_athlete table links workouts to athletes.
‚Ä¢ The gym can assign workouts even before the athlete signs up.
